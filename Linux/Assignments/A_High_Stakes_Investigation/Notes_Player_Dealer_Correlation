Summary:
--------

After retrieving Lucky Duck Casino's data from their database system, I analyzed days where they experienced
major losses. More specifically, data of their wins and losses, player analysis, and dealer schedules from
March 10th, 12th, and 15th. After isolating all of the losses from the win/loss player database, I was able
to identify one player in particular that was playing Roulette during those occurrences. 'Mylie Schmidt'
was the only player playing during each of those 13 occurrences. I then crossed referenced those specific 
dates and times with data from the dealer schedules database. I found that 'Billy Jones' was the primary Roulette 
dealer working during the 13 times Lucky Duck Casino experienced major losses. Based on my findings, 'Mylie Schmidt' 
and 'Billy Jones' were colluding to scam Lucky Duck Casino out of thousands of dollars.
